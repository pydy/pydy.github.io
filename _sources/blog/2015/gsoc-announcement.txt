Google Summer of Code season is rapidly approaching and we are happy to
announce that PyDy will be participating again this year. We are a
sub-organization under the Python Software Foundation and our symbolic code is
part of SymPy which is under both the PSF and NumFOCUS. Depending on the
project students can apply under one or both of the umbrella organizations.

We wish all students good luck and hope to hear from you all soon. Below you
will find more information to get started.
