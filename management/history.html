<h1>How Python Dynamics came to be<a class="headerlink" href="#how-python-dynamics-came-to-be" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Dale Peterson started graduate school at UC Davis in Fall of 2006 and met
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moorepants.info/">Jason Moore</a> in the
[[<a class="reference external" href="http://biosport.ucdavis.edu/">http://biosport.ucdavis.edu/</a><a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">|</span></a>Sports Biomechanics Lab]]. They shared a passion
for bicycles, dynamics and control and had both taken the multibody system
dynamics course  at UC Davis (MAE 223, taught by
<a class="reference external" href="http://mae.ucdavis.edu/faculty/hubbard/hubbard.html">Dr. Mont Hubbard</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://mae.ucdavis.edu/faculty/eke/eke.html">Dr. Fedelis Eke</a>). This course
teaches Kane&#8217;s method for deriving equations of motion, and at that time they
also taught <a class="reference external" href="http://www.autolev.com/">Autolev</a> (now defunct) in the course.
Autolev is very powerful at symbolic dynamics but lacks important functionality
and they both found themselves wanting a richer set of tools for studying
bicycles, rolling discs, rattlebacks, and other systems that are well described
by classical mechanics.  They dreamed of creating an open source tool that was
more extensible and nicer to use, but at the time neither of them had the
programming skills to make the dream a reality.</p>
<p>In Spring of 2007, Dale took
<a class="reference external" href="http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/">Dr. Jim Crutchfield&#8217;s</a> graduate physics
course in nonlinear dynamics and chaos, in which all homework was required to
be done using Python. This was a tall order for a single class! This was Dale&#8217;s
favorite course in graduate school and his first introduction to chaos and to
Python (and some of the chaos of Python).  About a year and a half later
(December 2008), Dale was tinkering with Python and trying to replicate some of
the kinematic functionality that made Autolev so convenient to use. He got some
basic classes created and contacted
<cite>Ondřej Čertík &lt;http://ondrejcertik.com/&gt;</cite>, the creator of the SymPy project to
see if he was interested in helping him get started. He made a trip up to his
apartment one weekend in January of 2009, and before he knew it, he had a good
chunk of the functionality he was looking for. Whcih was really exciting!
Ondřej encouraged Dale to apply to a Google Summer of Code, so he did, and he
spent the summer of 2009 working on a GSoC project that was a separate project
from SymPy.  This was a big learning experience, and one of the things that was
learned by the end of the summer was that the software should have been part of
the SymPy project, rather than its own standalone project. This led to Gilbert
Gede (another UC Davis graduate student) taking on a second GSoC project in
which he ported the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/pydy/">original PyDy code</a> into
SymPy as a sub-package &#8216;&#8217;sympy.physics.mechanics&#8217;&#8216;. This is what is currently
is in the SymPy repository. The software was introduced to the UC Davis
multibody dynamics course at the beginning of 2012, to replace the aging
Autolev. A third GoSC grant allowed Angadh Nanjangud to add Lagrangian dynamics
and many other features to the code base during the summer of 2012.</p>
