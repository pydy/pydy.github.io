Project Management
==================

A history of the development of PyDy can be found :doc:`here </management/history>`.

There is also an (out of date) :doc:`roadmap </management/roadmap>` for planned
and desired features.

Google Summer of Code
---------------------

PyDy exists because of support provided by multiple Google Summers of Code. We
still apply for student positions annual, both as an independent organization
and through other orgs (e.g., SymPy, Python Software Foundation). We maintain a
separate `Wiki on GitHub <https://github.com/pydy/pydy/wiki>`_ for all GSoC
related documents.
