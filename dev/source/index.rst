Introduction
------------

Welcome to the PyDy project page. PyDy, short for Python Dynamics, is a
*workflow* that utlizes an array of scientific tools written in the Python
programming language to study multibody dynamics. The core of this toolset is
the `SymPy <http://www.sympy.org>`_ **mechanics** package which generates
symbolic equations of motion for complex multibody systems. The remaining tools
used in the PyDy workflow are popular scientific Python packages such as
`NumPy <http://numpy.org/>`_, `SciPy <http://scipy.org>`_,
`IPython <http://ipython.org>`_, and `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_
which provide code for numerical analyses, simulation, and visualization. We
are a group of engineers and scientists who for one reason or another prefer to
work in Python. You can learn more by reading about our [features](features)
and our [history](history) or [examples](examples).
